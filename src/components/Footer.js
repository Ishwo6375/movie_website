            The design, style and content of a MovieNight.com website is generally meant
            to meet visitorsâ€™ expectations of that website. Visitors expect to
            find websites that are graphically rich, with audio and video as
            well. They expect something special, and entertainment value is
            often more important than the website being very accessible or
            fast-loading.
